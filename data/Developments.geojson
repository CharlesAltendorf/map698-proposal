The popular bar was created in 1957 and stood for 62 years until 2019. That is when the owner was forced to make the difficult decision to bulldoze the property. Luckily the bar's back, front, top, and beautiful stained glass were saved from the landfill. It was stored in a warehouse in hopes of preserving this piece of history. It remained untouched and left in the dark while the pandemic stopped the world, nearly forgotten. As the world began to emerge from restrictions, bars and restaurants from Ireland to Cincinnati began to see new life. On May 9th, 2022 this vintage piece of history was reborn and began its 57- day journey to Cincinnati, OH.
